# openai-playground
Play with OpenAI APIs

Each sub-dir is a Swift executable.

Before running any executable, set up OpenAI API Key in the command line first:
```fish
# Only set API Key for this shell session
set -x OPENAI_API_KEY <API_KEY>
```

Then, enter a sub-dir, run:
```fish
# the executable name should all be "test"
swift run test
```
